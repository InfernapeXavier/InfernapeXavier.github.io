## Development Practices

### Project Setup: Next.js Modern Website Migration

**Context**: Modernizing personal website by migrating to Next.js with updated development practices.

**Solution**: Set up proper development environment with:

- Cursor rules for consistent development practices
- Knowledge management system for tracking learnings
- Branch-based development workflow

**Implementation**:

1. Created and pushed feature branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/nextjs-modern
   git push -u origin feature/nextjs-modern
   ```

2. Established Cursor rules in `.cursor/rules/`:

   - `nextjs-development.mdc`: Next.js development standards
   - `styling-standards.mdc`: CSS and styling guidelines
   - `knowledge-management.mdc`: Documentation practices
   - `git-standards.mdc`: Version control practices
   - `rules-location.mdc`: Standards for organizing rule files

3. Set up knowledge management system:
   - Created `docs/knowledge.md` for centralized documentation
   - Implemented structured format for knowledge entries
   - Established guidelines for maintaining documentation

### Cursor Rules Organization

**Context**: Need for consistent organization and placement of Cursor rule files across the project.

**Solution**: Implemented standards for rule file organization following the `rules-location.mdc` specifications.

**Implementation**:

1. Directory Structure:

   ```
   PROJECT_ROOT/
   ├── .cursor/
   │   └── rules/
   │       ├── git-standards.mdc
   │       ├── knowledge-management.mdc
   │       ├── nextjs-development.mdc
   │       ├── rules-location.mdc
   │       └── styling-standards.mdc
   └── ...
   ```

2. Naming Conventions:

   - Use kebab-case for all filenames
   - Always use `.mdc` extension
   - Names clearly describe rule purpose

3. File Organization:

   - All rule files placed in `.cursor/rules/`
   - No rule files in project root or other directories
   - Each rule file follows MDC format with frontmatter

### Git Standards Implementation

**Context**: Need for consistent Git practices across the project to maintain clean version control and effective collaboration.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive Git standards covering branch naming, commit messages, workflows, and security practices.

**Implementation**:

1. Created `.cursor/rules/git-standards.mdc` with:

   - Branch naming conventions (feature/, fix/, refactor/, etc.)
   - Conventional Commits specification
   - Pull request templates and guidelines
   - Git workflow procedures
   - Security best practices

2. Example usage:

   ```bash
   # Branch naming
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

   # Commit message
   git commit -m "feat(component): add new feature description

   - Detailed change 1
   - Detailed change 2

   Closes #123"
   ```
