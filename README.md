I'm Rohit, a Computer Science student pursuing my MS in Computer Science at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu).
My interests include Databases and Systems engineering.

#### Tools I've worked with

`Python Rust Flask C/C++ SQL Bulma Bootstrap JavaScript TailwindCSS Android`

#### Tools I'm learning

`MongoDB Alexa-Skills-Kit`

Head on over to [my website](https://rohitc.tech) to learn more about my projects!

### This Website

I built this website using what my friend [@mihir3k](https://github.com/mihir3k) called an _abominable_ combination of `Bootstrap Bulma TailwindCSS`
Generally I would not do this, but I wanted my website to feel personal and I really like some parts of all three of these frameworks.

So, this website is indeed abomination and the embodiment of _No Compromise_
