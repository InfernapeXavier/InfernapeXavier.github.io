Hello, I'm Rohit, a Software Engineer at [academia.edu](https://academia.edu). I graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu).
My interests include _Databases_ and _Distributed Systems.

#### Tools I've worked with

`Python Rust Rails Ruby Flask C/C++ SQL JavaScript Android MongoDB Redis Alexa-Skills Golang TypeScript`

#### Tools I'm learning

`React`

Head on over to [my website](https://rohitc.tech) to learn more about my projects!

### This Website

I built this website using what my friend [@boromihir](https://github.com/boromihir) called an _abominable_ combination of `Bootstrap Bulma TailwindCSS`
Generally I would not do this, but I wanted my website to feel personal and I really like some parts of all three of these frameworks.

So, this website is indeed an abomination and the embodiment of _No Compromise_
